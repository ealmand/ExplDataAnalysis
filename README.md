# Coursera - Exploratory Data Analysis
## Project 1

The following information was provided by Coursera for this project.

* Introduction

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, this project uses the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which is available at:

    Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]

    Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset provided by the UCI web site:

    Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
    Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
    Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
    Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
    Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
    Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
    Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
    Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
    Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

* Loading the data

When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:

    The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. 

    This project uses data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.

* Making Plots

The overall goal of the project is to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is to reconstruct the plots provided by Coursera using the base plotting system.

A fork and clone of following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

For each plot

    Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

    Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

    Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file.

    Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository
